# TODO List App

A todo list app which I've personally started using on my phone as well. One can add todos which shall be timestamped. Also todos can be given either low/high priority based on which they shall sort themselves while viewing.
The app contains database connectivity and uses the SQFLite database which uses the local phone storage to store data. 

A simple project made while learning flutter.

## Perks of using SQFLite
- Transactional in nature
- Serverless database so no Client/Server connection required
- No external libraries dependency
- Light weight and sequential
